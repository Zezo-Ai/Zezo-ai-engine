Want to give your WordPress site a boost with some AI magic? AI Engine is here to help! It suggests new titles, excerpts, add a chatbot, and open the door to a whole new AI world through the AI Playground! It keeps track of your API usage stats too.

== Description ==

Ready to take your WordPress site to the next level with the power of AI? The AI Engine plugin is here to help!

Currently, it suggests titles and excerpts for your posts and keeps track of your OpenAI usage stats. There is also a shortcode that will create a ChatGPT-like discussion on your website. And finally, you'll find an AI Playground in which you will be able to do a bit of everything (translation, correction, SEO-related tasks, discussions, etc). But that's just the beginning!

We'll be continually adding new tools and features to the AI Engine based on your feedback, and even offering an API so other plugins can make use of it. Our goal is to create a toolbox full of useful AI tools and a framework that other plugins can build upon. And don't forget, our other Meow Apps plugins will soon be able to tap into the AI Engine too.

There's no doubt that we'll have a lot to discuss and options to consider as we work to improve and adapt the AI Engine to meet the needs of all our users. So let's get started and make the most of this amazing technology!

== Features ==

* Generate new titles for your posts.
* Generate new excerpts for your posts.
* Keep track of your OpenAI usage stats.
* AI Playground: Translation, correction, ChatGPT-like discussions, etc.
* ChatGPT-like discussions on your website, with a shortcode.
* Coming next: translation to any language.
* Coming next: improve a specific paragraph.
* And more features coming soon!

== Shortcode: A chatbot like ChatGPT ==

The current chatbot uses vanilla JS on your frontend, so it's extremely lightweight. There is no CSS, so you can style it as you wish. Enable it in the settings, and you can use the shortcode this way:

[mwai_chat context="Converse as if you were Michael Jackson, talking from the afterlife." ai_prompt="Michael: " user_prompt="You: " start_sentence="Hi, my friend." ]

== Open AI ==

The AI Engine utilizes the API from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com). This plugin does not gather any information from your OpenAI account except for the number of tokens utilized. The data transmitted to the OpenAI servers primarily consists of the content of your article and the context you specify. The usage shown in the plugin's settings is just for reference. It is important to check your usage on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage) for accurate information. Please also review their [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Service](https://openai.com/terms/) for further information.

== Usage ==

1. Create an account at OpenAI.
2. Create an API key and insert in the plugin settings (Meow Apps -> AI Engine).
3. Enjoy the features of AI Engine!
5. ... and always keep an eye on [your OpenAI usage](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage)!
