Elevate your WordPress site with AI! Generate content and images, add a ChatGPT-style bot that can be trained with your data, fine-tune AI models, have fun in the AI Playground, and more! It also tracks the OpenAI usage and offers an internal API for other plugins.

== Description ==

Ready to supercharge your WordPress site with the latest and greatest AI technology? The AI Engine plugin is here to help! With the AI Engine, you can generate content for your articles, suggest titles and excerpts for your posts, and track your OpenAI usage stats. Plus, there's a shortcode that lets you create a ChatGPT-style discussion on your website, and an AI Playground where you can try out a variety of tasks like translation, correction, SEO, and more.

But we're just getting started! We'll be adding even more AI tools and features to the AI Engine based on your feedback, and we're even offering an API so other plugins can tap into its capabilities. Our goal is to create a comprehensive toolbox of AI tools and a framework that other plugins can build on. And don't forget, our other Meow Apps plugins will soon be able to access the AI Engine too.

With the AI Engine, the possibilities are endless. Let's get started and make the most of this amazing technology!

== Features ==

* Generate fresh and engaging content for your site
* Explore the AI Playground for a variety of tools like translation, correction, and ChatGPT-style discussions
* Add a ChatGPT-style chatbot (or an images creation bot) to your website with a simple shortcode
* Train your AI to make it better at specific tasks
* Easily create new titles and excerpts for your posts
* Keep track of your OpenAI usage with built-in statistics
* Upcoming features include translation to any language and the ability to improve specific paragraphs
* And so much more on the way!

== Shortcode: ChatGPT & Image Generation Bot ==

Looking to add some AI-powered chat functionality to your website? Our chatbot is here to help! Using vanilla JS on the frontend, it's lightweight and easy to use, with this shortcode:

[mwai_chat context="Converse as if you were Michael Jackson, talking from the afterlife." ai_name="Michael: " user_name="You: " start_sentence="Hi, my friend." ]

There are a lot of parameters for the shortcode. And since there's no CSS included by default, you have complete control over the styling. However, there is an option to apply ChatGPT styling to the chatbot.

Please visite the [official documentation](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/) for more information. 

== Content Generator ==

Looking to add some fresh content to your site? With this feature, you can generate articles with customizable headings, language, and other parameters. Feel free to play around with the settings and even modify the prompts to create exactly the content you need.

== Image Generator ==

You can generate custom images using DALL-E model and various customizable parameters. Keep in mind that currently, the images generated are only in square format (1024x1024) and there are some limitations, but the plugin will adapt as the limitations change.

== Train your AI ==

In the Fine Tuning section of AI Engine, you can prepare datasets, manage them, and train new models based on them, it's just a few click.

== Meow Apps + AI ==

I am really excited about the amazing possibilities that AI technology brings to the world of online content creation. I believe that by working together, AI and humans can create something truly special. However, I don't want to see a boring web full of robot-generated content. Instead, I want AI to be used to boost and amplify the unique voice of human creators. New voices will be heard, new ideas will be shared, and new perspectives will be explored. Together, let's do this! ðŸ’•

== Open AI ==

The AI Engine utilizes the API from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com). This plugin does not gather any information from your OpenAI account except for the number of tokens utilized. The data transmitted to the OpenAI servers primarily consists of the content of your article and the context you specify. The usage shown in the plugin's settings is just for reference. It is important to check your usage on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage) for accurate information. Please also review their [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Service](https://openai.com/terms/) for further information.

== Usage ==

1. Create an account at OpenAI.
2. Create an API key and insert in the plugin settings (Meow Apps -> AI Engine).
3. Enjoy the features of AI Engine!
5. ... and always keep an eye on [your OpenAI usage](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage)!
