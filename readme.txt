== Shortcode: ChatGPT & Image Generation Bot ==

Looking to add some AI-powered chat functionality to your website? Our chatbot is here to help! Using vanilla JS on the frontend, it's lightweight and easy to use, with this shortcode: [mwai_chatbot]. Looks simple? Yes, but there are many parameters and countless ideas. Visite the [official documentation](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/) for more information. 

== Content Generator ==

Generate articles with customizable headings, language, and other parameters. Feel free to play around with the settings and even modify the prompts to craft exactly the content you need.

You can also generate images using DALL-E model. Keep in mind that currently, the images generated are only in square format (1024x1024) and there are some limitations (OpenAI is in beta).

== Train your AI ==

In the Fine Tuning section of AI Engine, you can prepare datasets, manage them, and train new models based on them, in just a few click.

== Meow Apps + AI ==

I am really excited about the amazing possibilities that AI technology brings to the world of online content creation. I believe that by working together, AI and humans can create something truly special. However, I don't want to see a boring web full of robot-generated content. Instead, I want AI to be used to boost and amplify the unique voice of human creators. New voices will be heard, new ideas will be shared, and new perspectives will be explored. Together, let's do this! ðŸ’•

== Open AI ==

The AI Engine utilizes the API from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com). This plugin does not gather any information from your OpenAI account except for the number of tokens utilized. The data transmitted to the OpenAI servers primarily consists of the content of your article and the context you specify. The usage shown in the plugin's settings is just for reference. It is important to check your usage on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage) for accurate information. Please also review their [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Service](https://openai.com/terms/) for further information.

== Usage ==

1. Create an account at OpenAI.
2. Create an API key and insert in the plugin settings (Meow Apps -> AI Engine).
3. Enjoy the features of AI Engine!
5. ... and always keep an eye on [your OpenAI usage](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage)!

Languages: English.
