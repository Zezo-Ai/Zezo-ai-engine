    prompt: 'The character is an anthropomorphic cat with a whimsical and endearing design, featuring a blend of white and blue fur. The right side of the cat\'s face has a patch of blue fur that also covers the outer part of the ear, while the left side remains predominantly white, except that the eye is surrounded by a green patch of fur. The tail mirrors this pattern with white fur leading to a blue tip. The character\'s facial expression is joyous, with a wide, open-mouthed smile showcasing a single front tooth and a small, black nose.  The cat\'s paws are also white, with defined fingers that suggest human-like dexterity. An orange collar encircles the neck, contrasting with the green and blue tones of the body. This collar is adorned with a blue and white emblem in the center, reminiscent of the WordPress logo. The drawing style of this image can be defined as a digital illustration with a cartoonish and whimsical aesthetic. It features bold outlines, flat colors, and simplified shapes which are typical of contemporary character design aimed at a broad, family-friendly audience. The style is reminiscent of modern vector art, which is often used for web graphics, animation, and media aimed at engaging a casual viewer with its clear, approachable, and vibrant visuals.',
